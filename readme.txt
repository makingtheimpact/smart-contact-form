This plugin creates a simple contact form with a built in spam protection without using captchas.

== Description ==

Smart Contact Form is a very fast and lightweight plugin. It uses several layers of protection to stop spam without inconveniencing users with captchas. 

The spam filter contains the list of the most commonly used spam words (in English). It also checks the message for http and www. The form also compares the load and submit times to prevent bots from abusing the form and trying to send messages rapidly. 

If spam is detected, the user is prompted to simply click a confirmation button to send the message. This extra step trips up most bots and prevents the message from ever being saved or sent.

Smart Contact Form only sends emails when the messages pass the spam tests. This prevents your inbox from being bombarded with useless spam emails that take up your time and energy sorting through! 

In the event a legitimate message fails the spam test, it is not lost as a copy of it will be saved in the database and is accessible from the Smart Contact Form Messages page. It will show that it is suspected spam, but will remain there for you to review. We recommend that you check it periodically to ensure that you have not missed any messages from your users. 

Additional Features: 
* Specify up to 5 different email addresses to send a copy of the messages to
* Set the list of subjects you want your users to choose from 
* Uses your theme's styles 
* Set the message that is displayed to your users after they submit the form 
* Specify a URL to forward your users to after they submit the form 

Setup is super easy! All you do is... 
1) Install and activate the plugin.
2) Place the [smart_contact_form] shortcode where you want the form to appear.
3) Sit back and relax... you're done! You can use the default settings and it will send the messages to the default admin email address. 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it prevent all spam? =

It should prevent 99.9% of spam messages. We have found it to be very effective in preventing spam on our sites. If a spammer uses a different language however, sometimes they can bypass the spam filter, but it is extremely rare. 

= Can I add words to the spam filter list? =

No, not at this time. If you would like words to be added to the filter list in future updates, you can contact us at solutions@makingtheimpact.com and send us the words you would like to add. If we determine they would be a good addition, then we will happily add them to the list, especially if they are in other languages like Russian.
